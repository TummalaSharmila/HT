## **COURSE NAME AND CODE:** COMP ANALY HIGH-TP BIOMED DATA: 25499

### **Programmer:** Sharmila Tummala

Date: 03/22/2025

### **Programming Language:** 
Python

### **Python version:** 
Python 3.11.11

### **Description:** 
I am submitting a Python script that predicts operons (defined as the longest contiguous multi-gene transcriptional units) using the PTT files for the following genomes:

Escherichia coli K12

Bacillus subtilis

Halobacterium

Synechocystis

Additionally, the script predicts operons in a crop microbiome from Hoatzin using the provided GFF file, which is equivalent to a PTT file. It identifies adjacent co-directional genes with an intervening distance of less than 50bp as being in the same operon.


### Packages needed: 
This python code needs numpy and pandas and gzip 
### How to run my program
I am submitting a google colab file in this zip file you can run it by clicking on the link in the .ipynb file

if you are using VScode
1. make sure the python extension is installed
2. download .ipynb file and open it using VScode and run the program by clicking on the run button present on the top right corner

### NOTE
1. Python has various IDEs, running this python file completely depends on the IDE you are using.
2. Keep python file and matrix files in the same folder.
3. If you can't access the file please give full file path
